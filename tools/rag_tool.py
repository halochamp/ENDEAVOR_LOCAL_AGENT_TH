"""rag_tool.py — Knowledge base search pipe via a separate local ENDEAVOR_RAG engine
(MiniLM + ChromaDB + BM25 + RRF), forked from ENDEAVOR_LOCAL_AGENT_MAX's tools/rag_tool.py.

This tool file ships WITHOUT any index/knowledge base of its own — that lives
in the sibling ENDEAVOR_RAG project (see _RAG_DIR below and the README's RAG
section). If the engine isn't present, rag_search returns an actionable
[error] telling you what to clone/build instead of crashing or silently
doing nothing.

Flow: rag_search(query) → raw parent chunks + SOURCES (absolute paths)
      → agent reads full file via existing read_file(path) if needed

    """Search the user's own local knowledge base via BM25 + vector search.

    Requires a separate ENDEAVOR_RAG engine set up alongside this repo (see
    README) — if it isn't present, this call returns an actionable [error]
    instead of a KB result; do not retry the same call, just report that to
    the user and fall back to web_search/other tools for the current need.

    The KB may hold BOTH Thai and English documents. Provide ALL 4 variants of
    the SAME question — each variant is searched separately (BM25 + dense) and
    results are RRF-fused, so cross-language variants reach documents the
    original language misses.

    HOW TO FILL EACH FIELD (query quality drives recall):
      sentence_th: the user's core question as ONE natural Thai sentence.
                   Strip greetings/filler (ช่วย/หน่อย/ครับ/ค่ะ) — keep only the info need.
      sentence_en: natural English translation of sentence_th (meaning, not word-by-word).
      keywords_th: 3-6 Thai CONTENT words — domain nouns + entities only;
                   no question words (อะไร/ยังไง/ไหม), no stopwords.
      keywords_en: 3-6 English terms — technical terms + synonyms + related jargon.
    RULES:
      - Keyword fields must NOT be a copy of the sentence — select terms, add synonyms.
      - ONE topic per call. Multi-topic question → one rag_search call per topic.
      - Optional mode:
          mode="chunks" (default): return top chunks + diagnostics.
          mode="files": return matched source files only.
          mode="source_first": return best source paths/read_file_hints first; use when user asks
            "จากเอกสารต้นฉบับ", "ครบทุกประเด็น", exact source detail, or chunks are insufficient.
      - Optional filters narrow the KB before returning: tags (all required), filename_contains,
        created_after/created_before (YYYY-MM-DD), source_type (md/pdf/docx/xlsx/csv).
      - tags uses AND semantics: every listed tag must be present in the document.
      - Prefer source_first when you expect a follow-up read_file call.

    Decision table:
      - Need a direct KB answer -> mode="chunks"
      - Need which source files are relevant -> mode="files"
      - Need source document / complete coverage / likely read_file next -> mode="source_first"
      - Multi-topic comparison -> one rag_search call per topic, never one combined query
      - User already constrained KB slice -> pass filters directly (tags / filename_contains / created_* / source_type)

    Chunks may not be an exact match — caller must verify relevance before synthesizing.

    Output format per chunk:
      RAG_DIAGNOSTICS: answerability / matched terms / retriever coverage / suggested next action
      [N] (source: filename | rrf: 0.xxxx | dense_hits: n | bm25_hits: n | raw_score: n | file: /absolute/path | created: ...)
      meta / heading / read_file_hint
      <chunk text>

    How to use the output:
      - answerability=direct: usually safe to synthesize from top chunks.
      - answerability=partial_need_full_file: open the best read_file_hint before final synthesis.
      - possible_mismatch=true: do not cite weak chunks as [KB]; narrow the query or inspect files.
      - dense_hits + bm25_hits together are stronger than only one retriever hitting.
      - heading shows the matched section path; use it to decide whether the snippet is actually on-topic.

    `created` is the doc's AUTHORING date (age = days since), not its data-as-of
    date — ⚠️ marks docs older than one year; weigh against evergreen vs time-sensitive topics.
    A `fs` tag (`created: … fs`) means the date came from filesystem birth time, not
    frontmatter — a weaker signal (may reflect a copy/sync, not authoring); trust it less.
    To read the full file: use read_file with the absolute path from 'file:' field.
    Prefer the exact read_file_hint when present.

    RELATED_DOCS may follow as structured YAML-like lines; use only when top chunks
    are insufficient or a second source/different angle is needed.
    Follow-up patterns:
      - Need exact source wording / whole section / complete coverage -> mode="source_first", then read_file.
      - Need only likely sources -> mode="files".
      - Empty/thin/mismatched result -> try one better single-topic query.
      - Error says candidates existed but filters removed all results -> relax filters before rewriting the whole query.
    [error] prefix = failure, no results, or the engine isn't set up.
    Do NOT use for general knowledge, math, small talk, coding, or current/web
    information — this only searches whatever local KB the user has built into
    their own ENDEAVOR_RAG engine, and returns nothing for anything outside it.
